# Preparation of the AppBuilder Dev environment

You ca install whatever of the two available versions of AppBuilder in your own coputer by following the below instructions:
	- For the installation of the Visual Studio Code you can follow the instructions from [Install and Configure the Blockchain App Builder Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/blockchain-cloud/usingoci/install-and-configure-dev-tools-vs-code-extension.html "Install and Configure the Blockchain App Builder Extension for Visual Studio Code")
	- For the installation of the Command line tool, follow the instructions from [Install and Configure Blockchain App Builder CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/blockchain-cloud/usingoci/install-and-configure-dev-tools-cli.html "Install and Configure Blockchain App Builder CLI")
  
In other hand, if you are not confortable installing in your own machine all the dependencies required to execute Microsoft Visual Builder Studio and the Oracle Blockchain App Builder plugin, but you have access to Oracle Cloud, you can opt to create the development box in the cloud, and access to it remotely.

In Oracle LiveLabs you have a Lab in which you will be able to deploy such machine based on a image already prepared by Oracle Blockchain dev team: 
to reach the lab where you can .....
1. Search in Google for ***Oracle Live Labs***.
<p align="center"  alt="Select The compartment where the instance of the founder organization will be created">

</p>

2. Push the first link, and in the Oracle LiveLabs page search for ***Low Code Blockchain*** labs.
<p align="center"  alt="Select The compartment where the instance of the founder organization will be created">

</p>

3. Select the ***Developing Low Code Blockchain Applications using Apex and Blockchain App Builder*** lab.
<p align="center"  alt="Select The compartment where the instance of the founder organization will be created">
<img width="328" height="273" src="https://github.com/jvillenap/Using-NFT-and-FT-Tokens-in-Oracle-Blockchain/blob/main/02-Prepare-Dev-Environment/images/2-dev-2-3.png"/>
</p>

4. Push the ***Star*** button to start the lab, and the select the only option you have to execute this lab ***Run on your tenant***.
<p align="center"  alt="Select The compartment where the instance of the founder organization will be created">
<img width="954" height="330" src="https://github.com/jvillenap/Using-NFT-and-FT-Tokens-in-Oracle-Blockchain/blob/main/02-Prepare-Dev-Environment/images/2-dev-2-4.png"/>
</p>

5. Once you are inside the Lab, to get a machine whith Visual Code Studio installed on it, ready to use the AppBuilder low code tool, you only need to execute the ***Prepare Setup *** and ***Environment Setup*** steps, which should not take more than 25 minutes in total.

</p>

All this work does not have too much relation with the objective of the HoL, but is something needed to be able to get an environment ready to use the low code tooling needed to begin to develope your smartcontracts.
