# Create an Oracle Blockchain Network

## Introduction

For the creation of an Oracle Blockchain network, you can use two different kinds of Oracle Blockchain instances:
- [Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service](https://www.google.com "Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service")
- [Oracle Blockchain Platform Enterprise Edition](https://www.oracle.com/blockchain/blockchain-platform-enterprise-edition/ "Oracle Blockchain Platform Enterprise Edition")

For simplicity in this HoL we are going to use the first, the Cloud Version. 

We are going to create two instances, the first isntance will be the founder of a new Hyperledger Fabric network, acting as the owner of the assets which will be represented as NFTs and will be available to be rented, and the second one which will be a new participant attached to the network, who will represent the lessee of the assets from the first participant.
