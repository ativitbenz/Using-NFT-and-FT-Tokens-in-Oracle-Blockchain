# Using NFT and FT Tokens in Oracle Blockchain
This HoL has been created to demonstrate how easily we can develop a solution without to much efford where FTs and/or NFTs were needed, thanks to Oracle Blockchain and the Oracle AppBuilder tool.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) are unique digital identifiers that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, recorded in a blockchain, and that is used to certify authenticity and custodianship. NFT is the perfect digital twin for whatever kind of physical or digital asset which can be used to track any usage, event, status change, or any other kind of peculiarity which makes sense to be tracked. Blockchain will provide an easily accesible inmutable history of the asset, which will be really valuable for whatever entity or person interested in the tracking performed on the asset itself.

Fungible Tokens (FT) are digital currencies designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. Using FTs you will be able to create whatever kind of echangable currency, controlling easily the accounting assinged to the users, and the privileges assigned to each participant to ensure a proper ussage of the network, obviously depending on the role of each user. 

Using Oracle Blockchain we are going to create in minutes an Hyperledger Fabric network as a founder, or join whatever existing Hyperledger Fabric network as a participant.



In the other hand, App Builder is a toolset developed by Oracle which will help you to create your Smartcontracts abstracting you from all the intrinsic technical complexities, even more when you need to create NFT or FT tokens. So, leveraging Oracle Blockchain and AppBuilder you will reduce considerably the time to market for any idea in which NFTs and FTs would be the perfect fit.

AppBuilder will help you to reduce considerably the complexity of the development, packaging, testing, and deployment of Hyperledger Fabric chaincodes, giving you the option to create them in different languages (TypeScript or Go).

Explain the use case:
rental of assets represented as NFT asking to pay using a digital coin represented as FT both tokens managed in the same blockchjain network!


[1. Create an Oracle Blockchain Network](../../blob/main/01-Create-The-Network/README.md)  
[2. Preparation of Oracle App Builder development environment](../../blob/main/02-Prepare-Dev-Environment/README.md)  
[3. Creation, Installation and Deployment of a SmartContract handling FTs](../../blob/main/03-Creation-and-Deployment-of-an-FT-SmartContract/README.md)  
[4. Creation, Installation and Deployment of a SmartContract handling NFTs](../../blob/main/04-Creation-and-Deployment-of-an-NFT-SmartContract/README.md)  
[5. Test the SmartContracts using Postman](../../blob/main/05-Test-Smartcontract-Using-Postman/README.md)  






Prerequisites:
1. Access to an Oracle Cloud account.
2. Install VS Code, and install AppBuilder pluigin in it. (expplained in chapter 2)
