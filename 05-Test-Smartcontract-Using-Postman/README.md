## Introduction

In this last chapter we are going to demonstrate how easily we can do a full test of a use case using a REST Client like Postman.

When you are dealing with Tokens, there is a bunch of administrative actions to be executed before being able to execute your business methods. 

Thanks to Oracle Blockchain, all the administrative actions ca be executed as API REST calls, so it simplify considerably the effort needed for the initialization.

We are going to perform a "dummy" initialization just with the minimum requirements to do a basic test.
